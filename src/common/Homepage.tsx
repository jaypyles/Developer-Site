            As a hobby, I like to run my own homelab, which can self-host
            several apps that I use reguarly. This website is being hosted in
            Docker on my server, which you accessed through Cloudflare
            proxy-dns. The API that controls the backend integrations is also
            being hosted on the same server. Down below are some links to other
            services that are publicly available:

            I have experience with developing RESTful API's, Relational/Graph
            database schemas, designing frontends for webapps, orchestrating
            Docker containers, and developing CI/CD pipelines. I consider myself
            to be most proficient in Python, but also have experience with C,
            Java, Java/Typescript, SQL, EdgeQL, and Rust. I am most interested
            in Software Engineering, Data Analysis Automation, and DevOps.
