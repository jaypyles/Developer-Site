# Developer Site

My [personal website](https://jaydenpyles.dev), which includes all of my social links, information about me, and some cool widgets which interact with an API to deliver information about me and what I'm doing!

Developed using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Material UI

## Architecture/Infra

Deployed using github actions, with k3s on kvm for deployments. ArgoCD for continuous deployment. Secrets management using Doppler.
